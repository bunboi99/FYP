Here's how you can use it:\n\nFirst, install the package with pip:\n\n```sh\npip install webdriver_manager\n```\n\nThen, in your script, you can use it like this:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\nfrom webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager\nimport time\nimport ultra\n\n# Create a new instance of the Chrome driver\noptions = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\noptions.add_argument('--headless')\noptions.add_argument('--no-sandbox')\noptions.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install(), options=options)\n\n# Rest of your code...\n```\n\nThe `webdriver_manager` package will automatically download the correct version of ChromeDriver for your system and use it to create the `webdriver.Chrome` instance.

Make sure that the versions of Selenium, ChromeDriver, and Chromium are compatible with each other.\n\nIf the issue persists, I would recommend trying to create a minimal reproducible example. Try to create a new Python script with only the necessary code to initialize the `webdriver.Chrome` instance and see if you still get the same error. This can help isolate the issue.",

ChromeDriver is a standalone server which implements WebDriver's wire protocol for Chromium. \n\nHere are the steps to install ChromeDriver:\n\n1. First, check your Chromium version. You can do this by opening Chromium and navigating to `chrome://version`. Note the Chromium version number.\n\n2. Go to the [ChromeDriver download page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and download the version of ChromeDriver that matches your Chromium version.\n\n3. Extract the downloaded file. You will find an executable file named `chromedriver` (or `chromedriver.exe` on Windows).\n\n4. Move the `chromedriver` executable to a location in your system's PATH. On Linux, `/usr/local/bin` is a common location. You can do this with the command `sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin` (you might need to adjust this command based on your actual paths).\n\n5. Verify the installation by running `chromedriver --version` in your terminal. It should return the version of the ChromeDriver.\n\nAfter these steps, you should be able to use Selenium with Chrome by specifying the path to the ChromeDriver when creating a `webdriver.Chrome` instance:\n\n```python\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/usr/local/bin/chromedriver', options=options)\n```\n\nReplace `'/usr/local/bin/chromedriver'` with the actual path where you placed the `chromedriver` executable. If you placed it in a location in your system's PATH, you can just use `'chromedriver'` as the `executable_path`.\n\nIf you encounter any issues during this process, please let me know!",

This suggests that either Chrome is not installed on your system, or it's installed in a location that's not in your system's PATH.\n\nHere are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Make sure that Google Chrome is installed on your system. You can do this by running `google-chrome --version` in your terminal. If Chrome is installed and in your system's PATH, this command should print the version of your installed Chrome.\n\n2. If Chrome is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official Chrome download page](https://www.google.com/chrome/).\n\n3. If Chrome is installed but not in your system's PATH, you can add it to the PATH. The exact steps to do this depend on your operating system and the location where Chrome is installed.\n\n4. If you're using Chromium instead of Google Chrome, you might need to install the `webdriver_manager` package from the `master` branch on GitHub, which includes a fix for detecting Chromium. You can do this by running `pip install git+https://github.com/SergeyPirogov/webdriver_manager.git` in your terminal.\n\nIf you encounter any issues during this process, please let me know!",

If your Chromium version is not listed, you might need to use a lower version of ChromeDriver that supports a range of Chromium versions which includes your version.\n\n4. Download the correct ChromeDriver version for your system (Linux, 32-bit or 64-bit) and extract the downloaded file to get the `chromedriver` executable.\n\n5. Move the `chromedriver` executable to a location in your system's PATH. For example, you can move it to `/usr/local/bin` by running `sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin` in your terminal.\n\n6. In your Python script, replace the line where you create the `webdriver.Chrome` instance with the following:\n\n```python\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome('/usr/local/bin/chromedriver', options=options)\n```\n\nThis code creates a `webdriver.Chrome` instance using the `chromedriver` executable that you manually downloaded and moved to `/usr/local/bin`.\n\nIf you encounter any issues during this process, please let me know!",

You need to use Selenium's Remote WebDriver and run a Selenium Server on your Raspberry Pi.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Download Selenium Server (also known as Selenium Standalone Server) from the [Selenium downloads page](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). You need to download the `.jar` file.\n\n2. Transfer the `.jar` file to your Raspberry Pi.\n\n3. Run the Selenium Server on your Raspberry Pi by executing the following command in the terminal:\n\n```sh\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-#.jar\n```\n\nReplace `#` with the version number of the Selenium Server you downloaded.\n\n4. On your local computer, instead of using `webdriver.Chrome`, use `webdriver.Remote` and point it to the Selenium Server running on your Raspberry Pi. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\n\noptions = Options()\noptions.add_argument(\"--headless\")  # add any options you need\n\ndriver = webdriver.Remote(\n    command_executor='http://raspberrypi:4444/wd/hub',  # replace 'raspberrypi' with the IP address of your Raspberry Pi\n    desired_capabilities=options.to_capabilities()\n)\n\ndriver.get(\"https://www.google.com\")\n```\n\nPlease note that you need to have Java installed on your Raspberry Pi to run the Selenium Server.

If you're accessing your Raspberry Pi via SSH, you might not have a graphical environment running.\n\n2. **Headless Mode**: If you don't have a graphical environment running, you can run the browser in headless mode. This means the browser runs in the background without displaying a window. You can enable headless mode by adding the `--headless` option when creating the `webdriver.Chrome` instance.\n\n3. **Performance**: Running a browser on a Raspberry Pi can be resource-intensive, especially for complex web pages.

Here's an example command:\n\n```sh\nssh -v pi@raspberrypi\n```\n\nReplace `pi@raspberrypi` with your Raspberry Pi's username and IP address.\n\n2. **Check the `DISPLAY` Environment Variable**: After connecting, check the value of the `DISPLAY` environment variable with the following command:\n\n```sh\necho $DISPLAY\n```\n\nIf X11 forwarding is enabled, this command should return a value like `localhost:10.0`. If X11 forwarding is not enabled, this command will not return a value.\n\n3. **Look for X11 Forwarding Messages in the SSH Output**: In the output of the `ssh -v` command, look for a line like this:\n\n```sh\ndebug1: Requesting X11 forwarding with authentication spoofing.\n```\n\nIf you see this line, it means that X11 forwarding is enabled.\n\nIf you encounter any issues during this process, please let me know!",

You can check this by looking at the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on your Raspberry Pi. There should be a line that says `X11Forwarding yes`. If it's not there, you can add it. If it's commented out (i.e., it has a `#` at the start of the line), you can uncomment it by removing the `#`.\n\nAfter making changes to the `sshd_config` file, you'll need to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect. You can do this with the following command:\n\n```sh\nsudo service ssh restart\n```\n\nOnce you've ensured that X11 forwarding is enabled on both the client and server side, try connecting again with the `-X` option:\n\n```sh\nssh -X wangding@raspberrypi\n```\n\nThen check the DISPLAY variable:\n\n```sh\necho $DISPLAY\n```\n\nIf it still doesn't return a value, there might be a problem with your X11 forwarding configuration or your Xming server.

You can try to resolve this issue by reinstalling Xming or manually adding the missing fonts.\n\nHowever, these font issues are unlikely to be the cause of your X11 forwarding problem. The log doesn't show any obvious errors related to X11 forwarding.\n\nHere are a few more things you can check:\n\n1. **SSH Client Configuration**: Make sure your SSH client is configured to allow X11 forwarding. If you're using OpenSSH, check the `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file on your local machine and make sure there's a line that says `ForwardX11 yes`.\n\n2. **Firewall Settings**: Some firewalls block X11 forwarding. Check your firewall settings to make sure they allow X11 forwarding.\n\n3. **Network Issues**: Network issues can sometimes cause problems with X11 forwarding. Try connecting to your Raspberry Pi from a different network and see if the problem persists.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, please let me know!",

First, ensure you have an X server like Xming or VcXsrv installed and running on your local Windows machine.\n\n2. Open your SSH config file. This is usually located at `~/.ssh/config` on your local machine. You can open it with a text editor.\n\n3. In the SSH config file, add (or modify) a Host entry for your Raspberry Pi. In this entry, add the line `ForwardX11 yes`. Here's an example:\n\n```sh\nHost my-raspberry-pi\n  HostName 192.168.0.123\n  User pi\n  ForwardX11 yes\n```\n\nReplace `my-raspberry-pi` with the alias you want to use for your Raspberry Pi, `192.168.0.123` with your Raspberry Pi's IP address, and `pi` with your username on the Raspberry Pi.\n\n4. Save and close the SSH config file.\n\n5. In Visual Studio Code, use the Remote - SSH extension to connect to your Raspberry Pi. Use the Host alias you specified in the SSH config file.\n\n6. After connecting, you should be able to run graphical applications from the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code, and the applications' windows should appear on your local machine.\n\nRemember, the X server must be running on your local machine for X11 forwarding to work.
